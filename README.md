## Game Play

The game is about territory.  Take turns placing tiles on the intersections of the grid lines and attempt to surround your opponent stones from all sides.  If you manage to surrond every side of an opponent's stone structure, then you capture all of those pieces and claim a point for every stone you surrounded.  A more indepth tutorial can be [found here](https://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html)

To run the app, execute the command:

`ant run` (Apache Ant JVM is required to run this program)

Then select `Start New Game` and choose your board size and begin playing.  Black goes first!

Enjoy!
